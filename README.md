## About the Project

**DoS (Denial of Service)** is a framework designed for educational purposes to simulate a single-machine attack on a target's server. This tool sends continuous HTTP requests to overload the server's resources, potentially rendering it unresponsive. It is inspired by the concept of **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)** but operates with a single device.  

### Key Differences Between DoS and DDoS
1. **DoS (Denial of Service):**  
   - Attacks originate from a single source.  
   - Easier to implement but limited in scalability and effectiveness.  

2. **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):**  
   - Uses multiple devices, often a botnet, to launch attacks from multiple locations.  
   - Highly scalable and difficult to defend against.  

### Can You Perform DDoS with Android?  
While Android devices can simulate **DoS attacks**, performing a true DDoS attack would require control over multiple devices (botnet). This framework is focused solely on **DoS simulation** and is not capable of managing distributed attacks.

## Features
- **Real-Time Statistics:** Track total requests, success rate, failed connections, and more.  
- **Interactive UI:** Built with the `rich` library for better user experience.  
- **Flexible Speed Configuration:** Customize delay between requests.  
- **Target Vulnerability Analysis:** Evaluate if the target is susceptible to the attack.
